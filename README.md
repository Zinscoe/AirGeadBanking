--Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.--

This project was created to get initial investments and show they would be affected with interest.

--What did you do particularly well?--

I used classes within this program particularly well.

--Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?--

I could enhance my code by shortening a lot of my variables. In doing so would allow me to write code that's more efficient by it being able to run quicker as well as making the program a little more shortened.

--Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?--

I personally thought defining functions within the classes was harder to me. As far as it goes for overcoming this issue, I took my time and tested my code a whole bunch to make sure the functions worked properly when called upon. The tools I used mostly was Googling my issues or going to w3schools.org

--What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?--

The skills from this project that would e particularly transferable to others is defining functions outside of each class and learning how to call them. In doing so, it allows me to understand functions that much more and be able to call them when needed.

--How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?--

I made this program readable by commenting a whole bunch! I'm sure that will help others out when reading the code as it helped me as I continued to proceed on this project and needing to refer back to certain parts.
